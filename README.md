# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analytics
# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation & Lifetime Value Prediction with RFM and Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the *Fundamentals of Data Analytics* course. It explores customer segmentation and lifetime value prediction using the **RFM model** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) in combination with unsupervised machine learning algorithms: **K-Means**, **K-Means++**, and **K-Medoids**. The project also implements **Pareto/NBD** and **Gamma-Gamma** models to forecast **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. A dataset of 4,024 retail customers was used, and all analysis was performed using **Python**, **Google Colab**, and **Excel**.
